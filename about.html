<p>My name is Le Ba Hieu Giang. My English-speaking friends call me Joe.</p>

<p>I’m a Computer Science major in National University of Singapore and a true blue Hanoian.</p>

<p>I’ve been a diehard supporter of Manchester United since I was 9. I enjoy blues, crime novels, cats, good movies (imdb 8.0 and above) and of course programming.</p>

<p>I believe in the importance of flexibility when it comes to software development. Hence, I chose to focus on the core ideas, instead of <i>really</i> mastering any particular stack. With the current momentum, any technology would become obsolete in a heartbeat.</p> 

<p>I've had my experience with both client-side and server-side development, and found myself leaning towards the latter.</p>

<p> I enjoy technical challenges and would love to discuss cool ideas. <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">Email</a> me if you would like to chat :)</p>
