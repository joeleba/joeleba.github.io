<p>My name is Le Ba Hieu Giang. My English-speaking friends call me Joe.</p>

<p>I’m a Computer Science major in National University of Singapore.</p>

<p>I’ve been a diehard supporter of Manchester United since I was 9. I enjoy blues, crime novels, cats, good movies and of course programming.</p>

<p>As a developer I've had my experience with both client-side and server-side development, and found myself leaning towards the latter. I believe in the true value of computer science as the most powerful problem-solving skill mankind has ever possesed.</p>

<p> I enjoy technical challenges and would love to discuss cool ideas. <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">Email</a> me if you would like to chat :)</p>
