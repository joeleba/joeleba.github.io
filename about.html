<p>My name is Le Ba Hieu Giang. My English-speaking friends call me Joe.</p>

<p>I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> in 2018. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Google in Munich, as part of the <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel team</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy technical challenges and would love to discuss cool ideas. <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">Email</a> me if you would like to chat :)</p>
