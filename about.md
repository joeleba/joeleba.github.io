Hi,

My name is Le Ba Hieu Giang. My English-speaking friends call me Joe.

I’m a Computer Science major in National University of Singapore and a true blue Hanoian.

I’ve been a diehard supporter of Manchester United since I was 9. I enjoy blues, crime novels, cats, good movies (imdb 8.0 and above) and of course programming.

As a developer, I enjoy technical challenges and would love to discuss cool ideas. [Email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) me if you would like to chat :)
